# Crowdsourcing Peak
The aim of this project is to validate a set of peaks using the crowdsourcing approach.

## Project  overview
It is a web application in which a user can sign up as either Worker or Manager, dependending on the role he wants to assume.

As a Manager, it is possible to create campaigns in which upload peaks to be validated and check whether a Worker created an Annotation.

After a campaign is created, a Manager should upload set of peaks in the campaign and start it, so that Workers can subscribe to that campaign
and annotate peaks.

Managers can also monitor statistics of campaigns, view the map of the campaign and refuse annotations.

And the IFML diagram, in order to understand how servlets and pages are linked to each other.
